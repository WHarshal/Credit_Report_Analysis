# Credit_Report_Analysis
## This project is undergoing 

This repository contains an analysis of credit scores using two different machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The analysis aims to predict creditworthiness based on various features and assess the performance of the models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of credit-related information for a set of individuals. It includes features such as age, income, employment status, credit history, and other relevant factors. The target variable is the credit score, indicating the creditworthiness of each individual.

## Files
credit_score_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis pipeline.
data.csv: CSV file containing the dataset used for the analysis.
## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the analysis:
- pandas
 -numpy
-scikit-learn
-matplotlib
-seaborn
You can install the dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the files.
Place the data.csv file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.
Open the credit_score_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis step-by-step.
Analysis Overview
The analysis includes the following steps:

Loading and Exploring the Data: Load the dataset, examine the features and their distributions, and identify any missing values.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, transforming categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Decision Tree Model: Build a Decision Tree model, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data. Visualize the decision tree.
Logistic Regression Model: Build a Logistic Regression model, train it on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the testing data. Examine the coefficients and interpret the model.
Model Comparison: Compare the performance of the Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models based on evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Conclusion: Summarize the findings, discuss the strengths and limitations of each model, and suggest areas for further improvement.
Results
The analysis provides insights into the predictive power of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models for credit score analysis. The models' performance metrics and interpretability help in understanding the factors influencing creditworthiness and making informed decisions.
